- **Description: I am building a full CRUD application that will be a performers professional page to advertise their professional performance career. The index page will be a short introduction into who that person is (performance photo with their name and other clickable tabs to an About Me section, performances, contact info., events, etc.). When you click on a tab it will take you to a show page (About Me section, performances, contact info., events, etc.). Depending on the tab you select, it will give you a detailed description of that person, a detailed outline of their resume, photos from events, videos, upcoming events, etc. The user will be able to navigate the site and contact performer if they so choose.**
